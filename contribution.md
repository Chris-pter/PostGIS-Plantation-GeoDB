## 🤝 Contribution Guidlines
Contributions are welcome and highly appreciated.
This project is publicly shared for learning, transparency, and community discussion., but it is **not an open-source project in the traditional sense**

The database design is actively used within my department as part of an internal GIS initiative. Therefore, direct code contributions (PRs) may be limited, but the following are warmly welcome:
You can contribute in several ways:

- Suggest improvements to the schema design or relationships.
- Propose indexing or query optimization strategies.
- Share ideas for geospatial ETL/automation workflows.
- Enhance documentation or report issues/data integrity concerns.

If you would like to propose improvements or ask questions, please open an **issues** first before making any PRs.
- This helps maintaining project stability while still benefiting from expert insights.

All contributions that help strengthen the geodatabase/geodata engineering workflow are welcome

## 🔧 Current Limitations & Future Improvements
To make sure this repository more robust, the following enhancements are planned:

- Additional indexing strategies.
- Automated SQL/python pipeline.
- CI/CD workflow for data validation.
- Improved ETL examples maybe using GDAL/advanced QGIS processing.
- Documentation in incremental are welcome.

Community suggestions are welcome.
